# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)
# Description
The Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) project is aimed at building a system capable of recognizing and extracting text from car's license plates. The project utilizes TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework, to train a model for license plate detection. Additionally, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques are employed to read the text from the detected license plates.The Dataset i used is avaibale on kaggle's Datasets https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/car-plate-detection

The main components of this project are:

License Plate Detection Model: A TensorFlow-based deep learning model trained to detect license plates in images.

Image Preprocessing: Appropriate preprocessing techniques are used to enhance the license plate regions before feeding them into the OCR module.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR): OCR techniques are applied to extract text from the detected license plate regions.

Tkinter interface: A simple GUI  to allow users to interact with the ANPR system and visualize  results with thier webcames.
